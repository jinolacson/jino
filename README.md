### Whoami


Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a hands-on developer, kind of like a tech wizard. With over a decade of experience in full-stack and software development, I work my magic using popular libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, Node, Express, Python, PHP, Java, Solidity, and Amazon Web Services. From the usual suspects like React and Vue to the more advanced ones like Solidity for Web 3, I build all sorts of web and software applications. Making sure they're not just pretty but also secure is my jam. I'm all about keeping user data safe and sound. And hey, I'm not stopping there â€“ I'm always learning and keeping up with the latest tech trends! ðŸš€
