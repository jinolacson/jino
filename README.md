## Hi :wave:

### About Me
With over a decade of experience as a Technical Lead and Full Stack Software Engineer, I have honed my skills across a vast array of technologies spanning both Web 2.0 and Web 3 stacks. My expertise includes developing applications using ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS, Express, Python, PHP, Java, Solidity and Amazon Web Services.

I have extensive experience building complete web applications with backend API systems, always taking a Secure Programming approach to prioritize security. This means that I am highly focused on ensuring that the applications I develop are protected against common vulnerabilities and threats, with a strong emphasis on maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user data.
